Directory: /b
This is the default build directory installed on mobbuild systems.

All running systems should mount a work directory over this. As is, this
directory does not have the correct permissions, or the space, for a build, and
your build will fail.

To get yourself some builder goodness, attach a large enough pre-formatted disk
with one of the following identifications:
- Filesystem label MOBBUILD_BUILD
- Filesystem id MOBBUILD_BUILD  # TODO(pprabhu) Add this support.
